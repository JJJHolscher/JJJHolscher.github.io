# Threats

A rationalist does not yield to threats, it is said.

Why?
Because if threats work, it incentivizes threatening.
Also because threateners can extract possibly unbounded value from you if you give.

But don't legal systems rely on the credible threat of violence to work? I'm [confused](open confusion.qmd).
